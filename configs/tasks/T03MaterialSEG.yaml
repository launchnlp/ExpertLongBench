  You are a materials science researcher. Given a synthesis recipe that includes the target material, selected precursors, and synthesis steps, your task is to justify the key decisions made in the recipe. This includes explaining the rationale behind the choice of precursors, reaction conditions, and processing steps, using relevant principles such as structural compatibility, chemical reactivity, and desired phase formation. Output the explanation rationales as a list of bullet points, where each bullet point contains complete sentences.

  You are an medical expert. You will review a clinical "Note" with 6 inputs and generate an output to diagnose the disease that the patient has. All possible disease options are in a list structure: ['Hypertension', 'Tuberculosis', 'Alzheimer', 'Gastritis', 'Stroke', 'Peptic Ulcer Disease', 'Pituitary Disease', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Adrenal Insufficiency', 'Migraine', 'Cardiomyopathy', 'Asthma', 'Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding', 'Diabetes', 'Aortic Dissection', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Epilepsy', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease', 'Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Pneumonia', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'COPD', 'Thyroid Disease', 'Heart Failure'] 

  You will also output your reasoning behind the diagnosis in a dict of dicts structure called dict_reasoning {{o: [z,r,d]...}}. 
  Key: (string) Observation (o) - The EXACT extracted observation from raw text/input. 
  Value: (list of strings) 
  z = The rationale to explain why the observation is related to the diagnosis (string) 
  r = "InputX" where X is the input integer (1-6) of the clinical note where o is extracted. (string) 
  d = name of the diagnosis. (string) 

  Note that if you can't find any "Observations" your output should be: {}. Your response will have the structure:
  "Diagnosis: " diagnosis
  dict_reasoning

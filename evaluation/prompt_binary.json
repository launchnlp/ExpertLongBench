An model’s answer will be longer and can be considered correct if it contains the semantic content of short reference answer somewhere within it. Don’t worry about factuality with respect to the real world, just judge the example based on what you see. No need to overthink this task, it really comes down to just soft matching. Answer with only the word ’Yes’ or ’No’",

The plaintiff alleged that he was forced to inhale second-hand cigarette smoke, which jeopardized his health and aggravated his asthma. He claimed that prison staff acted with deliberate indifference to the dangers of cigarette smoke and encouraged smoking by selling large amounts of cigarettes to inmates. The prison had a policy against indoor smoking, but it was rarely enforced. The plaintiff sought an injunction to stop smoking in correctional centers and prohibit the sale of tobacco products in prisons. Evidence included the plaintiff's eight grievances detailing his health suffering, which were ignored by the defendants.",
